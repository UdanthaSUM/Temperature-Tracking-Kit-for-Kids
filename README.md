# Temperature-Tracking-Kit-for-Kids

## Introduction
This project, developed during my training at Idea8 (Pvt) Ltd, is a prototype wearable device designed to monitor children’s body temperature safely and non-intrusively. The goal was to create a proof-of-concept for potential mass production, focusing on child safety, comfort, and accurate temperature tracking.

## Key Features
Wearable design tailored for children
